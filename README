Power flow data for 39 bus New England system.

Data taken from [1] with the following modifications/additions:

    - renumbered gen buses consecutively (as in [2] and [4])
    - added Pmin = 0 for all gens
    - added Qmin, Qmax for gens at 31 & 39 (copied from gen at 35)
    - added Vg based on V in bus data (missing for bus 39)
    - added Vg, Pg, Pd, Qd at bus 39 from [2] (same in [4])
    - added Pmax at bus 39: Pmax = Pg + 100
    - added line flow limits and area data from [4]
    - added voltage limits, Vmax = 1.06, Vmin = 0.94
    - added identical quadratic generator costs
    - increased Pmax for gen at bus 34 from 308 to 508
      (assumed typo in [1], makes initial solved case feasible)
    - re-solved power flow

Notes:
    - Bus 39, its generator and 2 connecting lines were added
      (by authors of [1]) to represent the interconnection with
      the rest of the eastern interconnect, and did not include
      Vg, Pg, Qg, Pd, Qd, Pmin, Pmax, Qmin or Qmax.
    - As the swing bus, bus 31 did not include and Q limits.
    - The voltages, etc in [1] appear to be quite close to the
      power flow solution of the case before adding bus 39 with
      it's generator and connecting branches, though the solution
      is not exact.
    - Explicit voltage setpoints for gen buses are not given, so
      they are taken from the bus data, however this results in two
      binding Q limits at buses 34 & 37, so the corresponding
      voltages have probably deviated from their original setpoints.
    - The generator locations and types are as follows:
        1   30      hydro
        2   31      nuke01
        3   32      nuke02
        4   33      fossil02
        5   34      fossil01
        6   35      nuke03
        7   36      fossil04
        8   37      nuke04
        9   38      nuke05
        10  39      interconnection to rest of US/Canada

This is a solved power flow case, but it includes the following
violations:
    - Pmax violated at bus 31: Pg = 677.87, Pmax = 646
    - Qmin violated at bus 37: Qg = -1.37,  Qmin = 0
